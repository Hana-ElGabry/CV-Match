# CareerPilot
This project focuses on developing an innovative web platform aimed at assisting students and job-seeking individuals of all ages in creating professional portfolios and enhancing their career readiness. Building a portfolio is made easier by the platform, and it can be readily exported as a resume, cover letter, or other professional documents.

By collecting user information post-login, the system customizes the portfolio creation experience and adapts its features to meet individual needs. Additionally, the platform offers personalized course recommendations based on the user's profile and insights derived from similar users' activities.

It promotes networking by allowing users to interact with like-minded people. The website also delivers specialised employment recommendations based on the user's qualifications and interests.
One notable element of the site is its AI-powered video interview simulation. This tool uses speech recognition and conversational AI to simulate real-life interview circumstances, giving users an engaging and immersive experience to help them improve their interview abilities. The platform's multidimensional strategy enables users to improve their professional presence, upskill successfully, and achieve their career objectives.
